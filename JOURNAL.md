The Idea (29/05/2025)

I am pitching a clap controlled lamp as a 6 point custom project.
The lamp will be of a miniature size and its colour will be controlled by clapping.
2 claps turns it off and on and 1 clap will change its colour.
The lamp will feature adjustable sensitivity as well as a variety of colours spanning from red to yellow to green to blue as well as everything in between.
The hardware will not be naked and a casing will be built from 3D printing.
I have decided to avoid the use of a PCB for this certain project.
I am looking forward to getting this project approved and eventually building it.


Circuit Diagram (30/05/2025)

I have used kicad to design my circuit diagram, I spent around 3 hours designing this circuit.
This was my first time using kicad and note some parts may differ in models to the BoM tomorrow due to accessibility of parts in the software.


Bill of Materials (31/05/2025)

Today I spent 3 hours determining every part I needed, the quantity of that part and the lowest possible reasonable price online. 
I relied on the companies: Rapid Robotics, Little Bird, Core Electronics and Digikey for my parts. 
I have left the 3D printed case section blank as I will start its design either tomorrow or the day after. 
The overall price of this project is $73.49 AUD not including shipping costs or 3D printing costs.
My budget in AUD is $231.40 which puts me well below my budget leaving room for any mistakes or miscalculations later on.


3D Printed Case (2/06/2025)

Today I spent 3 hours on working for a 3D case design.
The LEDS will hang over the model (with a translucent plastic as a form of lamp shade).
The electronics which power the circuit is found hidden in the base of the lamp and I have left an open compartment for the USB connector, potentiometer and sound sensor.
The model has been split into 4 parts for easy printing.
This is my first time ever using a 3D modelling software and this simple model gave me lots of troubles.
I prevailed and am eager to learn more.
