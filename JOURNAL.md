The Idea (29/05/2025)

I am pitching a clap controlled lamp as a 6 point custom project.
The lamp will be of a miniature size and its colour will be controlled by clapping.
2 claps turns it off and on and 1 clap will change its colour.
The lamp will feature adjustable sensitivity as well as a variety of colours spanning from red to yellow to green to blue as well as everything in between.
The hardware will not be naked and a casing will be built from 3D printing.
I have decided to avoid the use of a PCB for this certain project.
I am looking forward to getting this project approved and eventually building it.
I will spend 5 hours every day I work on it.


Circuit Diagram (30/05/2025)

I have used kicad to design my circuit diagram.
This was my first time using kicad and note some parts may differ in models to the BoM tomorrow due to accessibility of parts in the software.
I quite enjoy electronics so I am honoured to have the chance to learn about this software first hand.
I ran into some problems with wiring and part selecting but it ended up all fine in the end.

1 hour watching tutorials
2 hours compiling parts
2 hours connecting parts
1 hour  neatening up
Overall 5 hours

Bill of Materials (31/05/2025)

Today I determinined every part I needed, the quantity of that part and the lowest possible reasonable price online. 
I relied on the companies: Rapid Robotics, Little Bird, Core Electronics and Digikey for my parts. 
I have left the 3D printed case section blank as I will start its design either tomorrow or the day after. 
The overall price of this project is $73.49 AUD not including shipping costs or 3D printing costs.
My budget in AUD is $231.40 which puts me well below my budget leaving room for any mistakes or miscalculations later on.
I didnt run into many problems in this section, just took a little while to research for parts.

1 hour compiling parts
3 hours looking for the lowest pricing
1 hour neatening up the table
Overall 5 hours

3D Printed Case (2/06/2025)

Today I worked on a 3D case design.
The LEDS will hang over the model (with a translucent plastic as a form of lamp shade).
The electronics which power the circuit is found hidden in the base of the lamp and I have left an open compartment for the USB connector, potentiometer and sound sensor.
The model has been split into 4 parts for easy printing.
This is my first time ever using a 3D modelling software and this simple model gave me lots of troubles.
I had to learn which each tool does but I prevailed and am eager to learn more.

1 hour experimenting and watching tutorials.
3 hours designing.
1 hour finalising.
Overall 5 hours

ClapLamp Code (7/06/2025)

It has been a busy week of assesments so I havent worked on this in a while. 
I finally coded this project.
I am a beginer coder and this took alot of research to code.
My code requires a library in order to work.
I have used the Arduino IDE to fix up my code using the verify mechanic.
The code works online and I hope it will work in the actual hardware.
The main trouble I had was the fixing of the code after verifying it (I cant read error messages very well).

1 hour watching tutorials
3 hours coding
2 hours ironing out mistakes
Overall 5 hours

ClapLamp 3D Print Revamp (21/06/2025)

It has come to my attention that there are flaws with my 3d print design.
These flaws come in the dimensions and assembly of the clamplamp.
I have completely revamped the 3D print adding a hole for the USB aswell as making the whole design one part so no assembly or dissambly is required.

2 hours of revamping
