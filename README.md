# ClapLamp-Highway
An ESP32-powered lamp whose colour and power can be controlled by simple clapping. It features adjustable sensitivity and an assortment of different colors.
I am building this project because I am an amateur in hardware and software. I am eager to learn more about electronics because I am considering a job in the field. I would also like to participate in the Undercity. My science teacher initially gave me the idea for this project, and I want to show him what I am capable of.
