# ClapLamp-Highway
A ESP32 powered lamp whose colour and power can be controlled by simple clapping. Feauturing adjustable sensativity and an assortmant of different coulours.
I got the idea from this idea after seeing RGB lights and wondered if the colour could controlled by a simple action (such as a clap)
I am pitching the project for 6 points and i have spent 15 hours on this project.

I am building this project as I am an amateur in hardware and software. I am eager to learn more about electronics as I am considering a job in the field. I would also like to participate in the undercity.
